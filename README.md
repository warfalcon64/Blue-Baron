# Blue-Baron
This is a repository for a game I'm currenlty working on during my free time. Having completed tutorial projects in Unity in the past, I decided to create my own game with the idea of having all the assets and code within it created from scratch to get a feel of end to end game development. In the future, once I have achieved a more playable game, I will share Unity builds that will allow users to play the game in the most stable state.

## Gameplay:
Blue Baron is heavily inspired by one of the first flash games I played as a kid, called Azul Baronis, which was a 2D spaceship combat game with almost a hundred ships on different colored teams fighting each other in multiple levels. It was the player's job to take control of a ship on the blue team and defeat all the enemy ships in a level to continue advancing until finally beating the game.

I plan on building more types of ships and mechanics on top of this and removing the level component to make the game more strategic and cohesive. Initially there will be a blue and orange team, with the player in charge of the blue team. In order to win, the player must control all of the space stations spread around a map of a galaxy. Both teams will build and move fleets of ships in a turn based fashion, with battles occuring whenever they happen to meet each other at the same space station. There will be resource management related to how many stations a team controls along with upgrading ships to become more powerful and grant an advantage in combat. Once a playable (and hopefully enjoyable) game state is established, I plan on using machine learning to make the game harder for players on a strategic level, such that the enemy will adapt its own fleet composition to counter the player's fleets throughout the entire game rather than simply relying on static modifiers to gain more resources or more powerful ships.

## Art:
I have created all of the current art myself using Photoshop, and all of the current VFX is based on Unity's Shader Graph and Visual Effect Graph.

## Sound:
I plan on making my own music for this project using the DAW FL Studio. I have not yet reached the point of developing sound effects, but will plan on using software to assist in creating my own.
