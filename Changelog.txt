Things to implement:
- Bomber craft with a turret
- Make AI attempt to dodge missiles
- Add flares/chaff to distract missiles
- Make missile tracking more complex (ie give it cone of sight for locking on, once target moves past cone it just goes forward until finding another target in cone)

Things to fix:
- Radar blip issues when selecting enemies through radar UI (potentially just forgo this feature and have 'select nearest enemy' button instead)
